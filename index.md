### 1. NNTR / EOM <input id="link1" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
If your email message doesn't require a reply, add **NNTR** ("No need to respond") to the Subject line or the end of your message.

If your message can be expressed in half a dozen words, just put it in the subject line, followed by **EOM** (= End of Message). This saves the recipient having to open the message.

### 2. Respect Recipients’ Time <input id="link2" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
As the sender, it is on you to minimize the time the email will take to process.

### 3. Attack Attachments <input id="link3" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
Don’t use graphics files as logos, or signatures that appear as attachments. Instead [insert the image from URL](https://www.mail-signatures.com/articles/insert-internetlinked-image-outlook-signature/) - this will prevent the image being included as an attachment. Time is wasted trying to see if there’s something to open (it also takes more server power to send - which isn't great for the environment!).

### 4. Cut Contentless Responses <input id="link4" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
You don’t need to reply to every email, especially not those that are themselves clear responses. An email saying “Thanks for your note. I’m in.” does not need you to reply “Great.” That just cost someone another 30 seconds.

### 5. Short or Slow Responses are Not Rude <input id="link5" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
Just because you can respond fast doesn’t mean you should. It is okay if replies take a while to come. Please don’t take it personally.

### 6. Make Subject Lines and Content Clear <input id="link6" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
Start with a subject line that clearly labels the topic. Try including a status category [Info], [Action], [Time Sens], [Low Priority]. Use crisp, muddle-free sentences. If the email has to be longer than [five sentences](http://five.sentenc.es/), make sure the first provides the basic reason for writing. Avoid strange fonts and colours.

### 7. Stop Open-Ended Questions <input id="link7" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
It isn't helpful to send four long paragraphs followed by “Thoughts?”. Even well-intended-but-open questions like “How can I help?” may not be that helpful. Email generosity requires simplifying easy-to-answer questions. “Can I help best by a) calling b) visiting or c) staying out of it?!”

### 8. Slash Surplus CC’s <input id="link8" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
CC’s are like mating bunnies. For every recipient you add, you are dramatically multiplying total response time. Not to be done lightly! When there are multiple recipients, please don’t default to ‘Reply All’. Maybe you only need to cc a couple of people on the original thread. Or none.

### 9. Tighten the Thread <input id="link9" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
Some emails depend for their meaning on context. Which means it’s usually right to include the thread being responded to. But it’s rare that a thread should extend to more than 3 emails. Before sending, cut what’s not relevant. Or consider making a phone call instead.

### 10. Disconnect <input id="link10" type="button" value="🔗" title="Click to Copy"/>
If we all agree to spend less time doing email, we’d all get less email. Consider blocking out time at work where you don’t go online. Or make a commitment to email-free weekends. Add an auto-responder in your off time that references this charter.
