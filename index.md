## About
The below is an *adapted* version of the Email Charter originally created in response to widespread acknowledgement that email is getting out of hand for many people. The original Charter started life as a [blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012653/http://tedchris.posthaven.com/help-create-an-email-charter) by TED Curator Chris Anderson and TED Scribe Jane Wulf. The idea struck a chord and more than 45,000 people read the post. It generated hundreds of Tweets, comments and suggestions. Some of the contributors to the original Charter are listed [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012653/http://emailcharter.org/comments.html).

### Feel free to [add the Email Charter to your email signature](#add-to-email-signature).

---

### 1. NNTR / EOM
If your email message doesn't require a reply, add **NNTR** ("No need to respond") to the Subject line or the end of your message.

If your message can be expressed in half a dozen words, just put it in the subject line, followed by **EOM** (= End of Message). This saves the recipient having to open the message.

### 2. Respect Recipients’ Time
As the sender, it is on you to minimize the time the email will take to process.

### 3. Attack Attachments
Don’t use graphics files as logos, or signatures that appear as attachments. Instead [insert the image from URL](https://www.mail-signatures.com/articles/insert-internetlinked-image-outlook-signature/) - this will prevent the image being included as an attachment. Time is wasted trying to see if there’s something to open (it also takes more server power to send - which isn't great for the environment!).

### 4. Cut Contentless Responses
You don’t need to reply to every email, especially not those that are themselves clear responses. An email saying “Thanks for your note. I’m in.” does not need you to reply “Great.” That just cost someone another 30 seconds.

### 5. Short or Slow Responses are Not Rude
Just because you can respond fast doesn’t mean you should. It is okay if replies take a while to come. Please don’t take it personally.

### 6. Make Subject Lines and Content Clear
Start with a subject line that clearly labels the topic. Try including a status category [Info], [Action], [Time Sens], [Low Priority]. Use crisp, muddle-free sentences. If the email has to be longer than [five sentences](http://five.sentenc.es/), make sure the first provides the basic reason for writing. Avoid strange fonts and colours.

### 7. Stop Open-Ended Questions
It isn't helpful to send four long paragraphs followed by “Thoughts?”. Even well-intended-but-open questions like “How can I help?” may not be that helpful. Email generosity requires simplifying easy-to-answer questions. “Can I help best by a) calling b) visiting or c) staying out of it?!”

### 8. Slash Surplus CC’s
CC’s are like mating bunnies. For every recipient you add, you are dramatically multiplying total response time. Not to be done lightly! When there are multiple recipients, please don’t default to ‘Reply All’. Maybe you only need to cc a couple of people on the original thread. Or none.

### 9. Tighten the Thread
Some emails depend for their meaning on context. Which means it’s usually right to include the thread being responded to. But it’s rare that a thread should extend to more than 3 emails. Before sending, cut what’s not relevant. Or consider making a phone call instead.

### 10. Disconnect
If we all agree to spend less time doing email, we’d all get less email. Consider blocking out time at work where you don’t go online. Or make a commitment to email-free weekends. Add an auto-responder in your off time that references this charter.
